These documentation pages describe how to configure, develop on and use EpiLink.

This section is kind of empty right now, but will be expanded as the project
grows.


\* The API is not intended to be used as an external API, although it technically could be used as such. Instance maintainers may forbid (e.g. through their ToS) usage of the API by anything other than the front-end.

## Important

A distinction must be made between "EpiLink" and an "EpiLink Instance".

* **EpiLink** is the software project, made of code and documentation. The 
  project is managed by the dev team. It is given with no warranties of any 
  kind.
* An **EpiLink Instance** is an individual deployment of EpiLink, a running
  server. The instance itself is ran by people who are not necessarily the
  developers of EpiLink. The people running an EpiLink Instance are "instance
  maintainers".

**It is the instance maintainers' responsibility to handle all GDPR related
requests and concerns and to come up with and apply terms of services.**

* Data: Discord ID, Microsoft ID hash (SHA-256)
* Lifespan: Until the account is deleted.

At the user's choice:

## Data that is transmitted to Discord

By default, EpiLink only sends information to Discord about who has an account (`_known` EpiLink role) and who has their identity recorded in the database (`_identified` EpiLink role) in the form of the [role mappings you configure](MaintainerGuide.md#discord-server-configuration).

## Things to keep in mind

Rules may incur additional data collection. This data is also transmitted to Discord in the form of the roles you configure.
